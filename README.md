# Bitcoin Bounty Job Challenge Platform

## Project Setup & Folder Structure
The project is structured as a standard Next.js application:

 `components/`: Reusable React components.
     `auth/`: Authentication related components.
     `bounties/`: Components for displaying and managing bounties and submissions.
     `common/`: Shared components like Layout, Navbar, Footer.
     `utils/`: Utility components like AuditLogDisplay.
 `lib/`: Helper functions, Firebase configuration, custom hooks.
     `firebase.ts`: Firebase app initialization.
     `auth.ts`: Firebase authentication logic.
     `firestore.ts`: Firestore database interaction functions.
     `hooks.ts`: Custom React hooks (e.g., `useAuth`).
 `pages/`: Next.js pages, representing routes in the application.
     `api/`: (Optional) Next.js API routes if not solely relying on Firebase Functions for backend.
 `public/`: Static assets.
 `styles/`: Global styles and CSS modules.
 `types/`: TypeScript type definitions.
 `.env.local`: Environment variables (Firebase config).

## Prerequisites

 Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
 npm or yarn
 A Firebase project (set up Firestore, Authentication)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://bitcoin-bounty.vercel.app/
cd bitcoin-bounty-platform

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
